# Contributing

The success of this project is only possible if we get a wide variety of viewpoints and experiences. As such, we are actively working to make contributing as easy as possible.

The current process involves writing [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files, which are then compiled into web pages using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
