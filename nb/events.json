Most are co-ed, have a communal dining program, and have regular social events. The most important aspects of our communities, however, the culture, social life, and atmosphere vary widely from house to house; each ILG prides itself on its own unique perks and quirks. If you might be interested in the ILGs, either as a place to live or just for free food and fun events, come check us out during our recruitment periods, which vary house to house.
