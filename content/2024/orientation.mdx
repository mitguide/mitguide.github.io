## Calendar of events

The calendar below should display correctly in your local time; however, to check to see if this is true: &ldquo;Orientation Kickoff&rdquo; should be on Sunday, August 23rd, at 3:00PM EDT (UTC-4:00).

Clicking the events will open the [Guidebook](https://guidebook.com/guide/173503/) page for that event, where you can find more details. This page simply offers a more &ldquo;Google Calendar&rdquo;-like view of Orientation week.
