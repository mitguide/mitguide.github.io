## Terms used on this page
* **IAP.** Indepedent Activities Period.
* **Subject.** One class that you can take.
* **Unit.** Credits are measured in units. One unit _very roughly_ translates to one hour of work per week.

## First year credit limits (in units)[^creditlimits]
|Term|Regular|[Discovery](#discovery)|Notes|
|:--:|:-----:|:---------------------:|:----|
|Fall|48|9|Most MIT subjects are 12 units; 48 units should equal 4 subjects.|
|IAP|12|0|All students are limited to 12 units during IAP.|
|Spring|60|9|**The average course load is 48 to 54 regular units.** No degree requires taking more than 54 units per semester.|

[Physical Education](https://physicaleducationandwellness.mit.edu/event/quarter-1-registration-3/) (PE) classes **do not** contribute to your credit limit. PE classes are graded on a point system; you need 8 points to graduate.

ROTC subjects **do not** count toward the first-year credit limit.

### Recommended subjects
Subjects recommended by departments for first-year students (these count towards the **regular** credit limit) can be found [here](https://firstyear.mit.edu/node/8387).

## First-year grading policies[^grading]

* **In your first semester and Independent Activities Period (IAP)**, you will receive grades of **Pass or No Record** (&ldquo;P/NR&rdquo;).
  * A grade of **C or above** is passing. Grades will be noted as **P** on your transcript.
  * A grade of **D** or **F** will only show up on internal transcripts; _no external transcript_ will have these records (&ldquo;No Record&rdquo;) without your permission &ndash; see [Use of Fall Term Hidden Grades](#hiddengrades).
  * Hidden grades of A, B, or C will be noted for internal advising purposes, but are not used in calculating GPA nor usable for any purpose other than advising.
* **In your second semester**, you will receive **A, B, or C** grades. **D and F grades are not recorded externally** (&ldquo;A/B/C/NR&rdquo;).
  * **A, B, and C** grades are recorded both internally and externally.
  * **D and F** grades are noted only internally; they will not appear on any external transcript.
  * Your GPA will only accumulate passing grades (i.e. A, B, or C).
* **For the Class of 2024**, you will be able to choose P/NR grading on **48 units** (any subject, including General Institute and Departmental requirements) starting your second semester (your first semester is already P/NR).
* **For the Class of 2024**, you **will not** be offered the opportunity to take early sophomore standing.

### Use of Fall Term Hidden Grades <a name="hiddengrades"></a>
* If a scholarship or other third-party _absolutely requires_ internal hidden grades (i.e. pass/no record on an official transcript is not sufficient), you will need to:
  * Go to the [Undergraduate Academic Administrator](https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/advising-resources-students/academic-administrators-officers) in each department in which you took a class (Physics, Math, etc.) to ask her/him to write a letter. **The undergraduate administrators are used to doing this for first-years, so you shouldn't worry that you are making an unusual request.**
  * **The letter should be addressed to you**, and should state, &ldquo;[Your name] took 8.01 (or 18.01, etc.) under the MIT freshman Pass/No Record grading system. Had an official grade been recorded for you, it would have been an X [whatever grade you received].&rdquo;
  * You may then forward a copy of this letter on to the scholarship for which you are applying.

### Requesting your transcript
You can get a copy of your external transcript from **Student Services Center, Room 11-120.**
