<br/>

* Be open to new things! Even if some events don't sound interesting, _names can be deceiving_, and try to meet as many new people as possible. Definitely use Orientation to experience something new.
* **Try to explore as many dorm communities as possible.** That way, you'll find a living group that you really fit well with.

## Self-care tips
* Disclaimer: some of these definitely just sound like common sense &ndash; I do believe that they are extremely important, no matter how ordinary they sound.
* **Exercise.** Twenty to thirty minutes will give you more energy than you use.
* **Sleep at least six hours.** The most difficult part of sleep is definitely scheduling your sleep around your community &ndash; when do they hang out, when do they pset, etc. However, it is also good to set hard limits on when you sleep, and set a schedule for when you wake up.
* **Drink lots of water.** Buy a high quality water bottle (one that won't spill in your backpack). Water helps your brain think clearly, helps keep you awake during those lecture _lulls_, and is good overall!
* **Eat healthy; eat (cooked) vegetables.** It's not too difficult to stir-fry vegetables (i.e. add some cooking oil, add some salt, dump the vegetables in, add water if it looks like the vegetables are going to burn). As much as I would like to say MIT Dining is fantastic, often it's not the healthiest. I have definitely felt that adding vegetables (that I had to buy/cook) to my diet made me feel less sleepy and sluggish.
* **Sometimes buying a small meal is better than a snack.** Late night snacks are common at MIT. But buying a small meal (a healthy sandwich, some cooked vegetables, etc.) can satisfy your hunger and help your brain think better than a starchy/sugary snack can.

### Additional self-care tips
* &ldquo;sometimes instead of partying u should stay in ur room with a fluffy blanket and watch netflix with your roommate with a bottle of wine

on a friday night
owo&rdquo; &mdash; supposedly an upperclassman

## Academic programs
* <Link to="/urop">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)</Link>

## Extracurricular activities
* Play an intramural sport.
* Don't overcommit.
  * You can work your way up to the number of clubs you're comfortable with.
  * If you're overcommitted, don't be afraid drop some clubs (but be transparent about it); club members are very understanding.

## Student experiences


## Classes and scheduling
* Generally, advisor meetings are about 15 to 20 minutes long. It's best to have thought about classes beforehand, and then discuss the major questions you have during the meeting.

## Preparing for the next four years
* [CourseRoad](https://courseroad.mit.edu/road/). CourseRoad helps you plan out your class schedule for your four years at MIT. Note that because some classes are not offered every year, your plan will change during your time here at MIT. CourseRoad is quite difficult to navigate; don't hesitate to reach out for help.
* [firehose.guide](https://firehose.guide/). An unofficial class/schedule planner for each semester. Because it is student run, some of the information may not be accurate; use the official [MIT Course Catalog](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/index.cgi) for the most up to date information.
* [FIREHOSE Google Docs Guides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZ-4H8vx8Rb4enMUdreYXSeQiZnh2FzotCFX2y8fV3Q/edit?usp=sharing). Guides on mailing lists, VPNs, free software, etc.
