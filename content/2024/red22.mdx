## Meeting other students
* [SCUFFY](https://scuffy.mit.edu/ESC-Events-a37325bb5ae542b4943f7d1a19b68ce2). Virtual residence exploration to find a community you belong in!
* [Activities Midway](https://midway.techx.io/). Thursday, August 27, 11AM to 1PM EDT.

## Self-care tips
* Disclaimer: some of these definitely just sound like common sense &endash; I do believe that they are extremely important, no matter how ordinary they sound.
* **Exercise.** Twenty to thirty minutes will give you more energy than you use.
* **Sleep at least six hours.** The most difficult part of sleep is definitely scheduling your sleep around your community &ndash; when do they hang out, when do they pset, etc. However, it is also good to set hard limits on when you sleep, and set a schedule for when you wake up.
* **Drink lots of water.**

## Academic programs

## Extracurricular activities
* Play an intramural sport.
* Don't overcommit.
  * You can work your way up to the number of clubs you're comfortable with.
  * If you're overcommitted, don't be afraid to say it and drop some clubs.

## Student experiences


## Classes and scheduling
* Generally, advisor meetings are about 15 to 20 minutes long. It's best to have thought about classes beforehand, and then discuss the major questions you have during the meeting.

## Preparing for the next four years
* [CourseRoad](https://courseroad.mit.edu/road/). CourseRoad is quite difficult to navigate; don't hesitate to reach out for help.
* [FIREHOSE Google Docs Guides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZ-4H8vx8Rb4enMUdreYXSeQiZnh2FzotCFX2y8fV3Q/edit?usp=sharing)
