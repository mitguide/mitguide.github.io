## Quick links
* **[UROP: Advertised Opportunities](https://urop.mit.edu/jobs-board)**. Principal investigators (PIs) and graduate students who are interested in having undergraduates help them often list projects they are working on here.
* **[List of UROP Coordinators](https://urop.mit.edu/node/1857)**. Every department and laboratory has a designated UROP liaison. These UROP Coordinators interpret the department's requirements, ensure academic rigor and research value in projects undertaken by faculty and student collaborators, and clarify policies and procedures for departmental review.
