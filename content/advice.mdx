## How to read this document

|Symbol|Explanation|
|:-----|:----------|
|ðŸŸ¥|High priority, please do these|
|ðŸŸ§|Priority, these are a good idea|
|ðŸŸ©|Recommended, give these a good consideration|
|ðŸŸ¦|Optional, will probably be beneficial, but no harm if ignored either|

## tl;dr (Too long, didn't read)
### Software
* Cloud storage with local sync: Google Drive + Insync, Dropbox, or both.

## Practical pointers

### Know the basics of MIT

#### Map

First, a key resource: [whereis.mit.edu](https://whereis.mit.edu/) lets you search up building and room numbers, and it will show you where it is. Very useful when looking for classrooms.

We like to joke that MIT's building numbering system is completely ridiculous (which to a large part, it is), but there are sections (I believe corresponding to when they were built) where the numbers make sense.

The Green building (building 54, &ldquo;the tall one&rdquo;) can be useful as a reference point when you're first familiarizing yourself with the campus.


### Studying

#### Go to office hours. Put the times in your calendar.
But, be prepared before you go. It's much more effective having attempted the problems beforehand.

#### Try to make a mental map of the topics in each class you take.

#### Keep a cumulative formula/cheatsheet for every class.

### Skills

#### Learn to code.
This doesn't mean to become Course 6.

#### Learn LaTeX.

#### Also learn Markdown.
Use these two guides:
* [Basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
* [Extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)

In fact, this document was written in Markdown, and then translated into a website!

#### Make a personal website.


### Productivity

#### Keep your backpack lightweight.

#### Buy a quality water bottle.
You're going to need water. It helps keep you focused.

Buy one that isn't likely going to leak in your backpack; it should &ldquo;fail closed,&rdquo; meaning that without any human interaction it should stay closed (sadly this is speaking from personal experience, _twice_)).

Here are some examples of what works:
* TODO 1
* TODO 2

Here are some of what doesn't work:
* TODO 1
* TODO 2

#### Use a personal URL shortener.

#### Use a calendar.
My advice is to use Google calendar to store all the events in your calendar, and then sync those events with whichever calendar app you would like to use (I use Apple Calendar for the side scrolling ergonomics).

#### Organize your folders; sync them to cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive.

#### Follow a general convention when naming your files.

#### Use a launcher on your computer.

* For Windows, there's [Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox) (though I haven't used it personally).
* For macOS, there's [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), which I have used.
* For Linux, there's [Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/), which I have also used.

These make opening files that you know the name of (if you follow a convention, as suggested in the previous section) very quick and convenient.

## General mindset

### Understand the basis of Girard's mimetic theory.

### ðŸŸ¦  Try to take a math class every semester.

## For first years especially
If you can't get a summer internship, that's totally fine. In the meantime, you can learn the following skills that will be of great benefit:

* General
    * Calculus
    * Linear Algebra
    * Differential Equations
* Course 6
    * Vim
    * Tmux
    * HTML/CSS/JavaScript
