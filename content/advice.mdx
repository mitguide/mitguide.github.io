## tl;dr (too long, didn't read)
I highly recommend that you read through the whole post, however, below I have chosen the most actionable items you can take.

### Software
* Cloud storage with local sync: Google Drive + Insync, Dropbox, or both.


## Practical pointers

### Know the basics of MIT

#### Map

First, a key resource: [whereis.mit.edu](https://whereis.mit.edu/) lets you search up building and room numbers, and it will show you where it is. Very useful when looking for classrooms.

We like to joke that MIT's building numbering system is completely ridiculous (which to a large part, it is), but there are sections (I believe corresponding to when they were built) where the numbers make sense.

The Green building (building 54, &ldquo;the tall one&rdquo;) can be useful as a reference point when you're first familiarizing yourself with the campus.


### Studying and academics

#### Go to office hours. Put the times in your calendar.
If you don't understand something, it's worthwhile to spend time and try to figure it out on your own. But you have to note that

_Know that there is a tendency to avoid the classes you're falling behind in._ It might feel embarrassing to walk into office hours completely lost. The TAs (teaching assistants) shouldn't care about that (if they do, they aren't doing their job correctly).

#### Make mental maps of the topics in each class you take. Keep a cumulative formula/cheatsheet as well.

The most obvious use case is that when midterms and final exams come along, you'll have a comprehensive set of topics and formulas to study and use on the exam (if cheatsheets are allowed).

More fundamentally, however, keeping the mental map updated helps remind you of what you have learned. It grounds you as to where you stand currently in the forest of the class's topics.

If you take _7.012 Introduction to Biology_, you'll see Professor Lander do a basic version of this, drawing the relationships between genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and genomics.

The formula sheet should provide more quantitative information that the mental map might simply summarize. It's also a useful reference when doing problem sets. You should also use this to take note of problem solving techniques and things that were confusing (as well as their explanations), so that you have a central point of reference later on.


#### Take pictures of your projects.

### Skills

#### Learn to code.
This doesn't mean to become Course 6. In fact, it is generally the combination of computer science with subject matter expertise (e.g. biology or chemistry) that leads to remarkable breakthroughs.

Programming is a general tool, as well as a problem solving mindset, both of which will make you more efficient and effective when getting stuff done.

#### Learn LaTeX.

#### Also learn Markdown.
Use these two guides:
* [Basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
* [Extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)

In fact, this document was written in Markdown, and then translated into a website!

#### Make a personal website.
I'd be happy to help you set this up.

### Productivity

#### Keep your backpack lightweight.

#### Buy a quality water bottle.
You're going to need water. It helps keep you focused. It doesn't really matter which

Buy one that isn't likely going to leak in your backpack; it should &ldquo;fail closed,&rdquo; meaning that without any human interaction it should stay closed (sadly this is speaking from personal experience, _twice_). _Do not_ get the Contigo Snapseal (no link on purpose) if you plan on keeping it in your backpack.

The [Contigo Autoseal West Loop Travel Mug](https://www.amazon.com/Contigo-AUTOSEAL-Vaccuum-Insulated-Stainless-Travel/dp/B073WB5DG9) is the one I use (I actually own two: one for water and one for coffee; also not affiliated with Contigo in any way).

#### Use a personal URL shortener.
You can also set your browser (at least for Firefox and Chrome) to automatically use your URL shortener after pressing a specific keystroke. For example, I have mapped the key `m` to my URL shortener. That means whenever I search `m 7012` in my browser, it automatically redirects to my URL shortener, which then redirects to the Stellar page for 7.012.

I'd be happy to help you set this up as well.

#### Use a calendar.
My advice is to use Google calendar to store all the events in your calendar, and then sync those events with whichever calendar app you would like to use (I use Apple Calendar for the side scrolling ergonomics).

#### Organize your folders; sync them to cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive.
Going into the semester organized keeps your momemtum high. A good folder structure that works for me is the following (an actual):

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ freshman
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ fa20
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 17.309
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 18.06
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 5.111
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 8.02
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ sp21
â”œâ”€â”€ sophomore
â”œâ”€â”€ junior
â””â”€â”€ senior
```

MIT also provides 200 GB (gigabytes) of free cloud storage on Dropbox; take advantage of this and backup your files.

#### Follow a general convention when naming your files.

#### Use a launcher on your computer.

* For Windows, there's [Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox) (though I haven't used it personally).
* For macOS, there's [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), which I have used.
* For Linux, there's [Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/), which I have also used.

These make opening files that you know the name of (if you follow a convention, as suggested in the previous section) very quick and convenient.

## General mindset

### Understand the basis of Girard's mimetic theory.[^girard]

### ðŸŸ¦  Try to take a math class every semester.

### Learn about mental frameworks.[^frameworks]

## For first years especially
If you can't get a summer internship, that's totally fine. In the meantime, you can learn the following skills that will be of great benefit:

* General
    * Calculus
    * Linear Algebra
    * Differential Equations
* Course 6
    * Vim
    * Tmux
    * HTML/CSS/JavaScript
